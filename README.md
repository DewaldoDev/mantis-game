## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have `node` downloaded. You can find the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
1. Once `node` is downloaded, install the dependencies using `npm install`. This will read the list of packages from `package.json` and install them into a `node_modules` folder.
1. Once your packages are downloaded, you can start up the application using `npx parcel src/index.html`. Parcel is a lightweight build tool. It allows you to do things like split up your JavaScript code into smaller files and use more modern syntax in your JavaScript. You should be able to see your program by visiting http://localhost:1234
